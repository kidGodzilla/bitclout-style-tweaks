# bitclout-style-tweaks

A collection of tiny style tweaks for the BitClout UI

![Screenshot](/screenshot.jpg?raw=true "Screenshot (default)")

TLDR; As a designer, the monospaced font being used "stylistically" annoys the bejeesus out of me, and I created this chrome extension to turn it off, and decided to make a few more tweaks along the way, to improve the user experience of other early BitClout users.

## Aspirations

I'd like to do a dark mode theme, but after exploring the structure of the CSS in detail for a few minutes, it just doesn't seem incredibly stable. A dark mode theme is going to be fiddly / hacky, might be something I delay doing until a version 2.

## Dark Mode (Experimental)

![Screenshot dark](/screenshot-dark.jpg?raw=true "Screenshot (dark)")

I've put together an MVP of "dark mode". A lot of the values are too generic (`#111, #222, etc.`) â€“ I'm just roughing it out. Ideally, these would be a bit tighter and a bit more nuanced.

You can uncomment the last big chunk of CSS in `src/inject/inject.css` if you want to enable it!


## Todo

There's still quite a bit of boilerplate that I might end up deleting, just so people don't have to read as much code to ensure I'm not stealing their keys ðŸ˜… 

I wanted to have a fancy settings menu for dark mode, but it ends up generating a lot of "stuff". Could remove it for v1, especially since dark mode might be too ambitious for the first release.
