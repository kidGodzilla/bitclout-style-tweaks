# Bitclout Dark Mode & Style Tweaks 

A collection of tiny style tweaks for the BitClout UI

![Screenshot](/screenshot.jpg?raw=true "Screenshot (default)")

TLDR; The monospaced font being used "stylistically" in place of a proportional font annoys the bejeesus out of me, so I created this extension to turn it off. I decided to make a few more tweaks along the way, to improve the user experience of other early BitClout users.

## Dark Mode (Experimental)

![Screenshot dark](/screenshot-dark.jpg?raw=true "Screenshot (dark)")

I've put together an MVP of "dark mode". A lot of the values are too generic (`#111, #222, etc.`) â€“ I'm just roughing it out. Ideally, these would be a bit tighter and a bit more nuanced.


## Todos

- [x] There's still quite a bit of boilerplate that I might end up deleting, just so people don't have to read as much code to ensure I'm not stealing their keys ðŸ˜… 

- [x] I wanted to have a fancy settings menu for dark mode, but it ends up generating a lot of "stuff". Could remove it for v1, especially since dark mode might be too ambitious for the first release.

- [x] Dark mode MVP completed
